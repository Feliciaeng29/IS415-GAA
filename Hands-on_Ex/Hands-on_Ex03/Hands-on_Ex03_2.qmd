title: "Hands on Exercise 3: 2nd Order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis Methods"
---

## **Installing and Loading the R packages**

In this hands-on exercise, five R packages will be used, they are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.

-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.

-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e.Â raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.

-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.

To install and launch the five R packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap)
```
