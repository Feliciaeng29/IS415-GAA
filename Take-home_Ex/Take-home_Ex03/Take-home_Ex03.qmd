title: "Take Home Exercise 3"
---

Take-home Exercise 3 will be similar to one of the prototype module prepared above in term of content but with the following differences:

-   You are required to prepare the prototype module report as Take-home Exercise 3 submission. This mean, it has to be published on your own coursework page.

-   You are required to include a section called UI design for the different components of the UIs for the proposed design.

In this take-home exercise, you are required to select one of the module of your proposed Geospatial Analytics Shiny Application and complete the following tasks:

-   To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,

-   To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,

-   To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and

-   To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.

# Required R packages for First and Second Order Spatial Point Patterns

1.  **tidyverse:**

    -   Purpose: A collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization, emphasizing a consistent and tidy data format.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Useful for cleaning and transforming spatial data into a structured format that facilitates analysis.

2.  **knitr:**

    -   Purpose: Dynamic report generation in R, allowing integration of R code and results into documents.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Enables the creation of documents that include spatial analysis results, making it easier to communicate and share findings.

3.  **rgdal:**

    -   Purpose: Provides bindings to the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) for reading and writing geospatial data formats.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Essential for handling spatial data in various formats, ensuring interoperability and compatibility.

4.  **maptools:**

    -   Purpose: Tools for reading and handling spatial objects, particularly shapefiles.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Facilitates the manipulation and analysis of spatial data, especially when dealing with shapefiles.

5.  **sf:**

    -   Purpose: Supports simple features for spatial data representation and manipulation.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Offers a modern and efficient way to handle spatial data, including points, lines, and polygons.

6.  **raster:**

    -   Purpose: Deals with gridded spatial data, such as satellite imagery or climate data.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Useful for working with raster data, which involves spatial information arranged in a grid.

7.  **spatstat:**

    -   Purpose: Analyzing spatial point patterns and processes.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Particularly focused on the first point spatial order, addressing the distribution and arrangement of individual points in space.

8.  **tmap:**

    -   Purpose: Creates thematic maps for visualizing spatial data.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Helps in visually exploring and interpreting spatial patterns in data.

9.  **tmaptools:**

    -   Purpose: Provides additional tools for working with thematic maps.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Complements tmap by offering additional functionalities for spatial data visualization.

10. **gridExtra:**

    -   Purpose: Extends the grid graphics system to arrange multiple grid-based figures on one page.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Useful for creating complex layouts when visualizing multiple spatial plots or maps.

11. **leaflet:**

    -   Purpose: Creates interactive web maps using JavaScript.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Enables the development of interactive maps, enhancing the exploration of spatial relationships and patterns.

12. **OpenStreetMap:**

    -   Purpose: Accesses and interacts with OpenStreetMap data.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Allows integration of OpenStreetMap data into spatial analysis, providing additional context to spatial patterns.

13. **ggstatsplot:**

    -   Purpose: Enhances ggplot2 with statistical summaries and plots.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Can be used for adding statistical summaries to spatial visualizations created with ggplot2.

14. **statsExpressions:**

    -   Purpose: Creates customizable expressions for statistical summaries.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Useful for customizing the presentation of statistical information in spatial analysis results.

15. **lubridate:**

    -   Purpose: Facilitates the manipulation of date-time objects.

    -   Relevance to spatial order: Helps in handling temporal aspects of spatial data, which is crucial in understanding how spatial patterns change over time.
