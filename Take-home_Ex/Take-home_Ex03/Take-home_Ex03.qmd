title: "Take Home Exercise 3"
---

Take-home Exercise 3 will be similar to one of the prototype module prepared above in term of content but with the following differences:

-   You are required to prepare the prototype module report as Take-home Exercise 3 submission. This mean, it has to be published on your own coursework page.

-   You are required to include a section called UI design for the different components of the UIs for the proposed design.

In this take-home exercise, you are required to select one of the module of your proposed Geospatial Analytics Shiny Application and complete the following tasks:

-   To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,

-   To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,

-   To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and

-   To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.

# Required R packages for First and Second Order Spatial Point Patterns

1.  **tidyverse:**

# Data that is available from Airbnb

[InsideAirbnb provides a snapshot of the following information:]{.underline}

-   Listings - Summary information on listings

-   Detailed Listings - Detailed listing information of airbnb for rent

-   Calendar - Detailed calendar data for listings

-   Reviews - Summary review data

-   Detailed Reviews - Detailed review data for listings

-   Neighbourhoods - list of neighbourhoods in the city and a neighbourhood GeoJSON file

## Readind data from Airbnb

```{r}
listings <- read_csv("data/listings.csv")
d_listings <- read_csv("data/detailedlistings.csv")
calendar <- read_csv("data/calendar.csv")
reviews <- read_csv("data/reviews.csv")
d_reviews <- read_csv("data/detailedreviews.csv")
neighbourhoods <- read_csv("data/neighbourhoods.csv")
```

## Reading Spatial data from Airbnb

```{r}
nhood_map_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/neighbourhoods.geojson", 
                        layer="neighbourhoods") %>%
                st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

# Data Cleaning

```{r}
glimpse(listings)
glimpse(reviews)
glimpse(d_reviews)
glimpse(calendar)
glimpse(d_listings)
```

Change the data type of id to characters

```{r}
listings <- listings %>% mutate_at(vars(id, host_id), as.character)
reviews <- reviews %>% mutate_at(vars(listing_id), as.character)
d_reviews <- d_reviews %>% mutate_at(vars(id, reviewer_id, listing_id), as.character)
calendar <- calendar %>% mutate_at(vars(listing_id), as.character)
d_listings <- d_listings %>% mutate_at(vars(host_id, id), as.character)
```

Change price in detailed listings to numerical & remove $ and, symbol in cloumns where currency is read as character.

```{r}
strip_dollars = function(x) {as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", x))}
d_listings[,61:65] <- sapply(d_listings[,61:65], strip_dollars)
d_listings[,67] <- sapply(d_listings[,67], strip_dollars)
```

## Check for Missing Data 

We check if there is any missing data and decide how to handle it. Missing data will include zero value, which we need to change to be able to analyse correctly.

### Listings data 

```{r}
skim(listings)
```

### Calender

```{r}
skim(calendar)
```

### Reviews and Detailed Reviews

```{r}
skim(reviews)
```
```{r}
skim(d_reviews)
```

### Detailed Listings

```{r}
skim(d_listings)
```


# Data Wrangling

We need to convert the listings data into sf object. 

```{r}
listings_sf <- listings %>% 
                st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                         crs = 4326) %>%
                st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

Display the 10 records and show the geometry type and we can check that projected CRIS is svy21.

```{r}
head(listings_sf)
```

Show the point details of the geometry column, givin gthe x, y coordianted in SVY21

```{r}
glimpse(listings_sf)
```

# Possible EDA

## Type of Accomdation

### ROom types by region

Summarizing the types of listings by neighbourhood groups

```{r}
regionlist <- listings %>%
              group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>%
              summarise(
                num_listings = n(),
                avg_price = mean(price),
                med_price = median(price))
```
Plotting the type of accomdation by region

```{r}
ggplot(regionlist, aes(x=room_type, fill = room_type)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
      geom_col(aes(y = num_listings)) +
      facet_grid(cols=vars(neighbourhood_group), margins = T, labeller = labeller(neighbourhood_group = label_wrap_gen(width = 5, multi_line = TRUE))) +
      labs(x = "", y = "No. of listings", fill = "Room Type")
```

## Pricing of Room Types

Remove price outliers

```{r}
outlier_price <- quantile(listings$price, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)
listings_cleanprice <- listings %>% filter(price <= outlier_price)
```

Plot boxplot of prices for each room type

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(listings, aes(x=room_type, fill = room_type)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "None") + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=price)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Listing Price", fill = "Room Type", title = "Listing price")
```

Cleaned pricing

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(listings_cleanprice, aes(x=room_type, fill = room_type)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=price)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Listing Price", fill = "Room Type", title = "Listing price (outliers removed)")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

```


```{r}

```


# Data that will be used for wrangling subzone map
