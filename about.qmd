`Hi there! I am Felicia currently a Year 3 computer science student💻`

On this website, I invite you to join me on my journey as I explore geospatial analysis✍️

> *Did you know? I have a deep appreciation for 🎞️Studio Ghibli movies—they never fail to captivate me. In addition to my love for these, I find solace in the realms of books📚 and the strokes of a paintbrush🎨 during my leisure hours.*
