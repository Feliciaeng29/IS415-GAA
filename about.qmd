Hi there! I am Felicia currently a Year 3 computer science student.

> Did you know? I have a deep appreciation for Studio Ghibli moviesâ€”they never fail to captivate me. In addition to my love for these, I find solace in the realms of books and the strokes of a paintbrush during my leisure hours.
